In the US, these tasks are among the services provided by over 2,500 local health departments serving all communities across the country. In addition to basic services that keep us safe on a daily basis, local health departments also prepare for and respond to large-scale national, regional, and local emergencies.</p>\n",

    "<p>In 2016, the survey asked each health department to identify five health departments they connected to the most. Connections among health departments facilitate information sharing and coordination of services and are especially important during public health emergencies.
